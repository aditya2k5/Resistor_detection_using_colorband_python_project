# Resistor_detection_using_colorband_python
This Python project is a command-line tool designed to simplify the interpretation and calculation of resistor color codes, making it easy to convert between resistance values (in ohms) and standard color band representations. Supporting both directions, it allows users to either input a numeric resistance value to get the corresponding 3-band color code, or to enter three color bands and instantly obtain the resistorâ€™s value in ohms. The tool follows the standard resistor color coding system as used in electronics worldwide and provides a practical utility for students, hobbyists, and engineers working with discrete components. With intuitive input handling and error checking, it serves as a quick reference and learning aid for understanding or decoding resistor color codes in circuit design, repair, and prototyping
